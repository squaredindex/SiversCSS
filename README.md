# SiversCSS

SiversCSS is a tiny bit of CSS with no classes that just uses semantic HTML5 elements to give a very minimalist style for simple articles/blogs. Heavily inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/), who's been practising [Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/) since before it was a thing.
